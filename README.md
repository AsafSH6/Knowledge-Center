The script (format_ads.js in public/scripts) contains "var index" which is initialized to -1 and used to test different dates.
If you choose to use my test cases, set index to 0 and remove the comment mark from lines 7 to 18.
Remember to change the screen ID to check the different cases.

The script reloads the messages every 3minutes from the server in case something changed.
